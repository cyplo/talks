* been here before, with a tragic talk, hope this one is more informative
* idea: to make starting conversations less awkward
* idea: i love talking about myself, so the idea here is to have it right now and exhaust it ;)
*
* choosing Codurance - talk about other possibilities there

* it's always me, not you - would really appreciate you telling me I'm wrong

* I'm better with gathering thoughts and then coming back to you - can get hotheaded when asked for an advice/opinion

talk to me about:

* FLOSS
    * licenses - what to choose for your public contributions, see if you can include a lib into work project
    * FLOSS alternatives for proprietary software
    *

* electronics - super basic - FLOSS in design
*
* right to repair
