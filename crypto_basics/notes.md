# warmup
volunteer[s] + 
group : guess number of crypto transactions

# examples
* car keys
* garage keys
* immobilizers
* public transport network info

# motivation for the talk
* so ubiqutous yet misundesrtood
* no master, but can provide points to start learning

# motivation for encrypting
* privacy - medical records


implementing - use libraries and understood designs because it's hard any other way
* don't use generic string comparison functions - timing attacks
*

quick on attacks:
* "properly implemented strong crypto still works"
* most of attacks - side channel ones

don't implement your own crypto
