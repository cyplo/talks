# Rust - why ?

Note:
What do you look for when choosing a programming tool ? 
The "ecosystem" => community much more than the language itself

---

# Rust has been built community-first 

Note: 
Rust founders were acutely aware of this, and added community tools early
* github - development in the open, listening to feedback
* rfc process, on github as well
* forums, irc

# Release train

# Package manager

Rust
* community
** forums, rfc
* release train + stability
** crater, bigquery 
* crossplatform


* growing community of existing legacy projects
"For a long while now Iâ€™ve been worried that the GNOME project would struggle to grow its contribution and stay attractive if it stuck to C in the long run (i.e. next 10-20 years)." - Alberto Ruiz

Rust does not have anything

* no NULL
* no exceptions
* no gc
* no inheritance
* no segfaults
* not much boilerplate
** type inference

Usage in the wild:

* FFI for critical (perf, security) parts a huge use case
* general purpose tech stack coming up quickly though

I'm a bit confused here. On the other hand, we have an ample amount of experienced Rust people that would love to do Rust jobs/trainings, and don't find any opportunites. But they are mainly freelance or running their business. [1][2]

It seems to me that these companies want to only work with their inside teams because someone came up with the idea to use Rust. It seems odd that the consulting market doesn't happen, though, even if it would make sense to hire externals for a PoC for example. It's not an unusual pattern though, my usual bread-and-butter software (Elasticsearch) is only now developing a freelance/consulting market.

Would anyone know ways to kickstart that?
