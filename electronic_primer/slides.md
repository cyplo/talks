* agenda:
* get intuition around electricity
* play with sample hardware
* try to sketch in software
* plan production, mention BOM, layout, manufacturing
* hardware hacker book

* Play with blinky, turn pots, press buttons, observer resistance changes
* Ask about where energy comes from
* Show motor running and not running where LED is visible
* Electricity as water
* Resistance as kid on a hose

Intuitions:
* everything is analogue, we quantize when we measure
* conservation of energy, energy flow matters
* digital is an abstraction
* still abstractions everywhere, assembler vs Java => asic design vs modules
* get potentiometer + led setup, show result on oscilloscope
* prototyping is harder, hence a need for more simulations than in software

Tools:
* multimeter
* oscilloscope
* breadboard
* kicad - design + talk about simulation
