* get intuition around electricity
* everything is analogue, we quantize when we measure
* digital is an abstraction
* still abstractions everywhere, assembler vs Java => asic design vs modules
* get potentiometer + led setup, show result on oscilloscope
* prototyping is harder, hence a need for more simulations than in software

Tools:
* multimeter
* oscilloscope
* breadboard
* kicad - design + talk about simulation
