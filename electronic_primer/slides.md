* agenda:
* get intuition around electricity - not necessarily electronics - electrons are small, need analogies to visualize, intuit
* play with sample hardware
* try to sketch in software
* plan production, mention BOM, layout, manufacturing - cost of prototyping high so simulation is needed
* hardware hacker book

* you can do physics - we won't
* you can do high frequency stuff - we won't
* show audio on oscilloscope ?

Fun facts:
* first telegraph
* smoke tests - the name

* Play with blinky, turn pots, press buttons, observer resistance changes
* Ask about where energy comes from
* Show motor running and not running where LED is visible
* Electricity as water
* Resistance as kid on a hose
* Volt, Watt, Joule(w/s), Ohm

Water analogy:
* Voltage - pressure
* Current - water current flow, how much water flows
* Resistance - pipe resistance, how small pipe is, how dirty it is etc

* probably won't be talking about inductors and capacitors


Intuitions:
* oscilloscopes -> first crt monitors
* everything is analogue, we quantize when we measure
* conservation of energy, energy flow matters
* digital is an abstraction
* still abstractions everywhere, assembler vs Java => asic design vs modules
* get potentiometer + led setup, show result on oscilloscope
* prototyping is harder, hence a need for more simulations than in software

Tools:
* multimeter
* oscilloscope
* breadboard
* kicad - design + talk about simulation
* every circuit vs LTSpice
