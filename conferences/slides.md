# Conferences you did not know existed and now you know you just need to go to.

Note: niche ones, you dind not know about

---

# [nucl.ai](http://nucl.ai/)

## what: artificial intelligence

Note: to me there is not much more niche than AI. everyone has heard about itbut noone really knows what's up there. ever fascinated by Conway's game of life ? automatas like that there. also game of life is a 'game' = lots of game industry people there

---

# [nucl.ai](http://nucl.ai/)
## why: eat Wiener Schnitzel with The Witcher devs in Vienna
Note: it's the clash between industry veterans and pure theory what makes it interesting  
you can see the cycles of academia feeding industry and vice-versa  
Petra and Alex - super cool people  
what to bring home - new friends, techniques from game dev, which are totally different from normal programming, 

---

# [Erlang Factory: EUC](http://www.erlang-factory.com/)

## what: functional programming
Note: EUC = Erlang User Conference
with FP being all the rage now, this is one of the best FP conferences in Europe
as with all good conferences it's not all about one thing, i.e. it's not all about Erlang in this case. Lots of distributed systems things

---

# [Erlang Factory: EUC](http://www.erlang-factory.com/)

## why: meet Joe Armstrong, 
## visit Stockholm
Note: swedish table, very cool to visit Ericsson's offices - some of the workshops were there. small conference, niche.

---

# [SoCraTes](https://www.socrates-conference.de/)
## What: software craftsmanship and testing
Note: a whole family of conferences spanning Europe. growing one conference wouldn't probably work, so there is several small ones. I was to codefreeze.

---

# [SoCraTes](https://www.socrates-conference.de/)
## Why: intimate, encourages active participation
Note:  was quite cool for me as forced me to prepare different activities for different kind of people. marketplace of ideas, self organizing, not lots of governance

---

# [CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress)
## What: CCC is beautiful and strange
Note: on the other hand, there is CCC - very organized. a conglomerate of different tracks and ideas. history of CCC. more research, less money. everyone's equal. lots of strange and friendly people.

---

# [CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress)
## Why: the most intense 4 days of the year
Note: remember Neo downloading kung-fu ? club mate - the legend goes that it was needed by German hackers. tracks, workshops, lockpicking, politics, meeting people. no room - no problem - streaming. meet RMS

---

# [The Dutch Camp & CCC (camp)]()
## what: CCC outdoors
Note: a tent, 10gbps connection, a middle of the forest

---

# [The Dutch Camp & CCC (camp)]()
## Why: be close to the nature and the people
Note: test your outdoor skills and tech, like solar powered stuff

---

# go and explore
## plan your next conference now. bonus points for speaking there
Note: talk to people. tech conferences allow you to start talking to strangers more easily - i.e. what's your project about ? better than internet - projects start there, by the time you lear about project on the net it's already big.
