# [nucl.ai](http://nucl.ai/)
## why: eat Weiner Schnitzel with The Witcher devs in Vienna
Note: it's the clash between industry veterans and pure theory what makes it interesting  
you can see the cycles of academia feeding industry and vice-versa  
Petra and Alex - super cool people

# [Erlang Factory: EUC](http://www.erlang-factory.com/)

## what: functional programming
Note: EUC = Erlang User Conference
with FP being all the rage now, this is one of the best FP conferences in Europe
as with all good conferences it's not all about one thing, i.e. it's not all about Erlang in this case. Lots of distributed systems things
