slides are mostly made with mdpress, using my cusotm theme, based on the default one  
use mdpress -r -s cypress [path] to run them  
most of the talks should have the slides prerendered in the respective directories  

this repository contains submodules  
please exec  

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
