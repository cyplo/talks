* 3 levels of stack ?
* put level on the board - people write their names in the categories
* divide into groups based on the interests

1) detect computers on your network
* different scans in nmap
* see what services the computers are running

2) set up a dns server for a subdomain

3) set up http server for 2 domains at one ip

4) write a single-threaded http server that serves each user with the info about them (echo server + ip and port of the client)
5) install streisand
6) install stringer on Heroku, under custom domain name

* c10k ?
* provide server on the network - spawn new ec2 instance ?
* you have inherited a server ?
